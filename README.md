# LSTM for character prediction
The task is to predict next character in the sequence using sequential model like LSTM . Here i have used shakespeare dataset to see how well does LSTM composes its own writing using some context learn over time on shakespeare writing.

## How to run the code:
```
python code/lstm_without_peephole.py	
```
##  
## TO-DO List:
- [x] LSTM without peephole connections.
- [ ] LSTM with peephole connections.
- [ ] Bidiectional  LSTM.
- [ ] Performance Matrix.
